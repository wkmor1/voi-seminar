# Value of information (VOI)

???

Thanks for coming

Talk too quietly let me know

Ask questions during talk if I don't make sense

Today will talk about narrow but important part of decision science


--
- .font120[Both a concept and a formal decision theoretic toolset]


???

Both a rigidly defined set of formal tools used in decision analysis also a more broad philosophy, can use to think about information and learning in context of decision making

--
- .font120[In context of decision making, information has some finite value]


???

VOI presupposes information has finite value can be compared and contrasted with the cost of information, and payoffs and losses of ultimate decision


--
- .font120[Can tell you whether to seek new information, how much, and what kind]


???

VOI is implicit acknowledgement of the decisioness of investing in learning 

Tools we have to assess how to make good decision can be applied to learning ahead of time

--
- .font120[Implies some uncertainty is critical to decision making and some is not]

.center[

]
???

Critical information can change the decision made and the value of its outcome

Non-critical information does not change the decision made regardless of its content,c by definition has no value.

# My VOI work

???

The work I have been doing on VOI is to examine and extend it's use in the conservation sciences 

--
- .font120[Value of information for management of box-ironbark woodlands]


???

Calculated VOI in the context of managing box-ironbark forests in Victoria

--
- .font120[Value of information for spatial conservation planning]


???

Demonstrated how you can calculate the VOI for reserve design

--
- .font120[Value of information for conservation auctions]


???

Explored ways of valuing information to optimise conservation auctions

--
- .font120[Value of information and risk tolerance]


???

Addressed the issue risk tolerance and it's effect on the value of information

---

Today just want to focus on these two pieces of work

---
class: inverse, center, middle

# Part 1: Value of information
## A little background & theory

???

Before I do. I'll just briefly touch on the theory of value of information for the benefit of those who may not be familiar

---
# Formal VOI

???

VOI is not new, it has been around since at least the 40s or 50s

--
## Expected Value of Information (EVI)

???

VOI almost always an expected value. Value from decision expected. sum of the outcomes weighted by their probability of happening

--
Difference between:
- Expected value of making decision with __original__ information (EVWOI)

and the

- Expected value of making decision with __new__ information (EVWNI)

</br>
</br>
$\Large\mathrm{EVI} = \mathrm{EVWNI} - \mathrm{EVWOI}$

???

VOI is the magnitude of the difference between these two expected values

---
# Formal VOI

## Expected Value With Original Information (EVWOI)

???

start with 2nd component

expected value of making the decision without resolving any uncertainty

--
$\Large\mathrm{EVWOI} = \max_a\mathrm{E}_\theta[v(a,\theta)]$

$\Large a$ = actions, alternatives etc

$\Large\theta$ = uncertainty, model, system state


???

First calculate the expected values of taking each  action and choose (maximise) the one with greatest expected outcome

(A) represents the actions you can take

(Theta) represents the uncertainty you have in the outcomes of those actions

---
# Formal VOI
## Many Forms of VOI


???

EVWOI is common to all of them
--
$\Large\mathrm{EV?I} = \mathrm{EVW?I} - \mathrm{EVWOI}$


???

What matters is the "new" information component

--
## Expected Value of Perfect Information (EVPI)


???

For example we can calculate the value of perfect information

--
$\Large\mathrm{EVPI} = \mathrm{EVWPI} - \mathrm{EVWOI}$

???

Which is the difference between the expected value with no uncertainty and the expected value with the original level of uncertainty

--

$\Large\mathrm{EVPI} = \mathrm{E}_\theta\max_a[v(a,\theta)] - \max_a\mathrm{E}_\theta[v(a,\theta)]$

???

EVWPI is only slightly different to EVWOI

just reverse the expectation and maximisation

Across the uncertainty find the action that maximisises value each time assuming certainty and then take the expectation of those values 

EVPI is the UPPER BOUND

# Implications


--
- Risk-neutral decision-maker with original information expects to maintain current population.


--
- In reality, either lose 5 or gain 5, with equal probability. But better than guaranteed loss of 2.


--
- Acting with certainty expect to gain 1.5 as can avoid the worst case of losing 5.


--
- Is therefore optimal to spend up to value of 1.5 breeding pairs worth of resources to find out! 


.center[![money](https://m.popkey.co/98e529/dZoqj.gif)]

???

Provided you can convert the value of 1.5 breeding pairs into the same currency as the cost of learning

# Formal VOI

## Expected Value of Sample Information


???

Before continuing highlight one more form of EVI

--
</br>
</br>
$\Large\mathrm{EVSI} = \mathrm{EVWSI} - \mathrm{EVWOI}$


???

The most general form of EVI, sample of information. 

That is unlike perfect information, it is not the EVI of resolving all uncertainty it is the value of only resolve a bit

--

$\Large\mathrm{EVSI} = \mathrm{E}_s[\max_a\mathrm{E}_{\theta|s}[v(a,\theta)]] - \max_a\mathrm{E}_\theta[v(a,\theta)]$


???

Without detail. in the same notation, can see there is an extra step of expectation and I introduced a term, s, to represent the sample of information. In reality this could the results of experiments or monitoring or even just a single observation

If we let the sample-size of, s, got to infinity you should be able to see that this term cancels out and this just becomes the value of perfect information

Purple lines show that looking in either direction you will see quite a different VOI

I have no proof but I think in general people doing both tend to be up this end (the right).

For much the same reason.

Informal: pick a subject with lots of data so they can subset and demonstrate it's worth

Formal: picking case-studies that are on well known studies were original information is rich

Here are the distribution maps based on the public occurrence data on the Atlas of Living Australia (random 30 records).

I've artificially reduced the available points so to ensure there is a measurable level of uncertainty.  

covariates used: mean solar radiation, annual mean temperature, annual precipitation, COV of precipitation, soil fertility and topographic wetness.

Not an exercise in trying to build the best model by any means

background-image: url(voi-seminar_files/figure-html/HunterPlan1.svg)

With those inputs the planning algorithm ranks sites in the west low and sites in the east high. with some low ranking cells around new castle and also along the coast. haven checked but this probably a pretty good map of existing and proposed coal mines :(

And the top 20% of those sites are these ones.

So if you ignore uncertainty and you could put reserves wherever you want over 20% of the region you'd put them here.

Ignoring a whole bunch of caveats like connectivity and the appropriateness of the objective function and missing species and other considerations.

Individual species will be expected to do better or worse on average, how worse?

With extra information we expect to be better able to trade some loss in a well protected species for greater gains in less well protected species.

Note this table still assumes we are learning everything there is to know about all species. Not one species at a time. That is called the expected value of partial perfect information. You'll have to read my thesis to see how that is done.

I have ordered them by their average ranking and divided them into three groups based on whether they ever cross the 20% threshold.

What this point represents is the point of indifference

decision maker is indifferent about which action they should take.

When the probability of failure is below they would chose to restore

Higher; and they would do nothing.

$\Large{} 5p + 15(1 - p) = 8p + 8(1 - p)$

EV(restore) = EV(do nothing)

This is the point where p satisfies this equality:

that expected values are equal to one another

# Risk tolerance

--
- Risk-neutral indifferent to uncertainty in payoff; only care about expected value


--
- Risk-averse sensitive to uncertainty in payoff; prefer the guarantee of small reward (or loss) over potential for large reward if might endure large loss


--
- e.g., risk averse prefer to do nothing and ensure 8 rather than risk only having 5 even if the expected value is 10


--
- Usually conservation decision makers are assumed to be risk-neutral. Not realistic?


--
- So how does this effect value of information?


--
- Since risk averse don't like uncertain outcomes, can assume risk-averse will value information more than risk neutral?

Before try to answer that question need to introduce the concept of utility

Think of utility as the perception of value. 

A risk neutral decision maker exhibits 1 to 1 relationship they perceive value as value and only care about maximising there expected value when making a decision

someone who is risk-averse, perceives diminishing returns with value and importantly the perceive high value has having comparably lower utility compared to a risk neutralists

???

So with this in mind we can think about the same problem in terms of expected utility of information

The risk neutral has the same outcome as we'd expect

Non-linear utility (one from previous graph) leads to non-linear relationship between p and EUPI

Looks like the relationship in general is true that risk aversity increases the value of information. Peak is higher and the area under the curve is larger.

But it is not as simple as that?? there is no trivial part of the graph were risk-neutral sees information value as greater.

The utility has shifted the point of indifference to the left.

When the risk-averse decision maker is a position of staying with the safe bet of doing nothing, they are often less willing to want to invest in learning more about the probability of than the risk neutral decision maker would be
